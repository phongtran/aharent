= HOW TO IMPORT ANY CSV/XML DATA TO WORDPRESS? =

Import can be done in different methods based on content source type, platform, and file types. The most common types of imports are XML, CSV and DB files.

1. Start by uploading a CSV/XML file.
2. Map the CSV/XML fields with appropriate WP fields.
3. Enable the media handling option if you want to import any external images.
4. Finally click the ‘Import’ button to import all your data into WordPress in one go.

CSV methods allow any users with basic excel or any spreadsheet knowledge to audit, change, edit or update the data visually in bulk before importing. CSV file is the most preferred method for any offline programs as it doesn’t require manual work and takes less time.

Xml method needs advanced knowledge to edit/update them in case of any changes required on source data. Otherwise, users are limited to import without any changes to the source file. Hence, editing post by post in WordPress is only possible after import.
